# Cat_Dog_Classifier


1. Image classification via fine-tuning with EfficientNet


2. Image Classification Using CNN 


  This code pattern demonstrates how images, specifically document images like id cards, application forms, cheque leaf, can be classified using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and EfficientNet. Even though there are code patterns for image classification, none of them showcase how to use CNN and EfficientNet to classify images using Tensorflow-Keras libraries.
